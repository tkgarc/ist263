    </head>
    <body>
        My name is Terina Garcia. I am a dual major studying Broadcast and Digital Journalism in Newhouse and Innovation, Society, and Technology in the iSchool. I am interested in pursuing a career within technology and media because I love storytelling as well as operating advanced machines or gadgets. I have been on the Dean’s list in both Newhouse and the iSchool consecutively since attending Syracuse, which is a huge feat. I am a radio personality/DJ for both the WJPZ and WERW stations here at Syracuse University, which is a very fun pastime since I love music. My hobbies include eating good food, spending time with family and friends, and going to the beach! I would say my favorite movie of all time has to be the cinematic masterpiece titled “Ratatouille”. I was born and raised in Hawaii and carry my home & culture with me in everything I do. I am excited to pursue a career in technology and media!
