        <h1>Terina Garcia's Biography</h1>
        <p>
            My name is Terina Garcia. I am a dual major studying 
            <strong>Broadcast and Digital Journalism in Newhouse and Innovation, Society, and Technology in the iSchool</strong>. 
            I am interested in pursuing a career within technology and media because I love storytelling as well as operating advanced 
            machines or gadgets.

        <h2>Personal Info</h2>
        <p>
            I have been on the Dean's List in both Newhouse and the iSchool consecutively since attending Syracuse, which is a huge feat. 
            I am a radio personality/DJ for both the WJPZ and WERW stations here at Syracuse University, which is a very fun pastime 
            since I love music. My hobbies include:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>eating good food</li>
            <li>spending time with family and friends</li>
            <li>going to the beach</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            I would say my favorite movie of all time has to be the cinematic masterpiece titled “Ratatouille”. 
            I was born and raised in Hawaii and carry my home & culture with me in everything I do. 
            I am excited to pursue a career in technology and media!
